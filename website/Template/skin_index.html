						<h3>skincancer</h3>
						<h4>Overview</h4>
						<p>	
						 Skin cancer, a prevalent form of cancer, often manifests through changes in moles or the development of new growths. Key indicators include asymmetry, irregular borders, varied colors, changes in size, and potential symptoms like itching, pain, or bleeding.
						 Regular skin self-examinations and professional dermatological check-ups are critical for early detection and prompt management, helping mitigate the risks associated with skin cancer. Awareness of these signs empowers individuals to seek timely medical attention, fostering better outcomes in skin cancer prevention and treatment.

						<h4>Symptoms</h4>
						<p>The signs and symptoms of pneumonia vary from mild to severe, depending on factors such as the type of germ causing the infection, and your age and overall health. Mild signs and symptoms often are similar to those of a cold or flu, but they last longer.

						Signs and symptoms of pneumonia may include:
						</p>
					    <ul>
					      <li>Watch for changes in the size, shape, color, or elevation of existing moles. New moles that appear later in life or exhibit unusual characteristics should also be monitored.</li>
					      <li>Asymmetrical moles or lesions, where one half does not match the other half, can be a potential indicator of skin cancer.</li>
					      <li>Skin cancer lesions often have irregular, poorly defined borders. Healthy moles typically have smooth and even edges.</li>
					      <li>Multiple colors within a mole or lesion, such as different shades of brown, black, red, or blue, may suggest skin cancer.</li>
					      <li>Rapid growth or changes in the size of a mole or lesion can be a concerning sign. Regular monitoring for alterations is important.</li>
					      <li>Skin cancer may cause itching, pain, tenderness, or bleeding. Any unexplained discomfort or changes in the skin should prompt a thorough examination.</li>
					      <li>Skin lesions that ulcerate or crust over may be indicative of certain types of skin cancer, particularly if they persist.</li>
