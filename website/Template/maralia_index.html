						<h3>Malaria</h3>
						<h4>Overview</h4>
						<p>	Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by the Plasmodium parasites. These parasites infect red blood cells, leading to symptoms such as fever, chills, headaches, muscle aches, and fatigue. Malaria is transmitted through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes.

							Malaria can vary in severity, from mild flu-like symptoms to severe complications, including organ failure. It poses a significant threat, especially to vulnerable populations such as children under five, pregnant women, and individuals with compromised immune systems.A variety of Plasmodium species, with Plasmodium falciparum being the most deadly, can cause malaria.
